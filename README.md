# COVID Analyst Portfolio Project
This project is done by using SQL(structure Query Language). In this project, I have tried to use most of the functions and clauses of SQL. 
I have taken data from "Our World in Data". It contains covid data from all over the world from 20th Feb. 2020 to 8th Jan 2022. 
Link of data: **"https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths"**

In this project I basically calculated answers to these five questions:
Q1. Count of deaths due to COVID?
Q2. Count of COVID cases?
Q3. What is the percentage of deaths with respect to the population?
Q4. What is the percentage of covid cases with respect to the population?
Q5. Mortality rate ( What is the percentage of deaths who got COVID?).

I calculated all these on five geographic  levels:
Global, continent, For all Asian countries, and For INDIA
